ABSOLUTE UNITS
px = pixels (1/96 of 1 inch) Pixels are bad for usability:
            (96px = 1 inch)     -they dont scale
                                -they dont help other elements to scale proportionally
                                Use them only when you really need an exact and fixed size

pt = point (1/72 of 1 inch)
            (72pt = 1 inch)
pc = pica  (12pt = 1pc)
mm = millimeter
cm = centimeter
in = inch

RELATIVE UNITS
% = Percentage  Relative to the parent element's value for that property
em = em       relative to the current font size of the element
rem = root em       relative to the font size of the root
ch = character  relative to the width of the "0"
vw = viewport   width relative to the width of the viewport
vh = viewport height ""
vmin = smaller dimension
vmax = larger dimension
ex = x-height   relative to the height of a lower case x

Do I need to scale an element when the viewport size changes?
What do I want it to scale relative to?
